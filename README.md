A hack that gives you the power to host your own party with the JBL Pulse 2 and PUSH2PARTY. Queue up your favorite music, push the button, and get ready to have a ball.

## How

We used JBL's Pulse 2 Android SDK to make an unrivaled partying experience with a sick minute countdown with the LEDs on the Pulse 2.
